- Download YouTube videos and convert them to high-quality MP3 files.
- Enhance audio quality using an Adobe AI-powered tool (Playwright integration).
- Interact with the Captivate.fm API to upload and publish podcasts with metadata.
- Support for handling multiple YouTube playlists and their corresponding podcasts.

- Audio processing functions like normalizing volume, combining MP3 files, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abe-101/podcast.git
## Usage

The script will prompt you to select a playlist/podcast from the available options.
It will then fetch the 15 most recent videos from the selected YouTube playlist.
The videos will be converted into podcasts using audio enhancement.
The resulting podcasts will be uploaded and published on Captivate.fm with metadata.

## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file named `config.json` to store data for multiple playlists/podcasts. The configuration file includes information such as API keys, playlist IDs, directory paths, and URLs. You can modify this file to add, remove, or update playlist data as needed.
```json
{
  "playlists": [
    {
      "podcast_show_id": "show_id_1",
      "spotify_id": "spotify_id_1",
      "dir": "/path/to/directory1",
      "apple_url": "apple_url_1",
      "rss": "rss_url_1",
      "playlist_id": "youtube_playlist_id_1",
      "captivate_api_key": "your_captivate_api_key_1",
